# roulette
Is a gambling game I created to be played fully in the terminal. It includes the common bet types that are allowed in an American roulette table. It consists of one class: Player.

<h2>Bet Types</h2>
<ul>
  <li>RedðŸ”´ or Blackâš«</li>
  <p>To bet on the opposing colors red or black and gives a payout of 1:1.</p>
  <li>Odd or Even</li>
  <p>Allows you to choose if the number will land on an odd or even number in the 36 numbers of roulette, a payout of 1:1.</p>
  <li>1 to 18 || 19 to 36</li>
  <p>Allows you to choose if the number will land on one half 1-18 or the other half 19-36, a payout of 1:1.</p>
  <li>Dozens</li>
  <p>There are 3 batches of 12 in 36 that you can choose to bet on, a payout of 2:1.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Problems I Encountered</h2>
This is my first project in python. Working with classes was a agreat experience also learning halfway through that global varaibles shared between classses are a Big Bad. I decided to take away my secondary class the Casino and see how well I could do with just one class. This mainly occured because I could not think of any ideas for what to use the Casino for especially when the Player class held all the information I needed to continue the game flow. This helped cement my foundational learnings of ranges.Towards the end I learned I should have made a game loop! To continue the game if self.balance > 0.
